        <u>Public access</u>
        <h4>
            <p>The registry is public available to everyone, without login or account.</p>

            <u>Contributors / lecturers</u>
            <p>For lecturers it's possible to create an account and add courses to the registry.
            <ul>
                <li>After registering for an account, this needs to be approved by the moderator or one of the administrators.
                    The account can't be used until it is approved.</li>
                <li>After adding a course, this needs to be approved by the moderator or one of the administrators. The course won't be
                    shown in the registry until it is approved.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <u>Moderators</u>
            <p>For most countries there is a moderator which curates the country and can approve courses and users in this country.
                There are several features available to manage the courses and users in the country.</p>

            <u>Administrators</u>
            <p>Countries without moderator are managed by the administrators.</p>

        <h4>
            <p>There are two ways to create an account:</p>
            <u>Registration form</u>
            <p>Lecturers can register for an account at <a href="https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/users/register">
                    https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/users/register</a>. After submitting the registration form, the following steps need to be completed:
            <ol>
                <li>Confirm the email address</li>
                <li>Set a password</li>
                <li>(Wait for) account approval by moderator</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <u>Invitation by a moderator</u>
            <p>Moderators can invite users through the application. In this case the lecturer receives an email with an invitation.
                The sender of this email is the moderator and as well a bcc of the email is sent to the moderator.<br>
                The advantage: fewer steps are required for the lecturer.
            <ol>
                <li>As a moderator visit <a href="https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/users/invite">https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/users/invite</a>
                    (maybe you need to login)</li>
                <li>Fill out the form and choose a localization. (The email address of the lecturer is also entered in this step.)</li>
                <li>The lecturer receives an email with a link to set a password. This link is valid for 24 hours.</li>
                <li><i>Not needed:</i> Confirmation of email address (already provided by the moderator)</li>
                <li><i>Not needed:</i> Account approval (sending the invitation email includes "instant approval")</li>
            </ol>

            <p>To keep the course meta data up to date, reminder emails are sent and there is a traffic-light color
                displayed in the course lists, which indicates when a course was last updated:
            <ol>
                <li>When a course is entered, it's shown <font color="green">green</font> in the list.</li>
                <li>After <u>10 months</u> the course owner receives emails with the request to update the course. The course
                    stays <font color="green">green</font> in the list.
                </li>
                <li>After <u>12 months</u> the moderator will be on the CC of the reminder emails. The course is shown
                    <font color="orange">orange</font> in the list.
                </li>
                <li>After <u>16 months</u>, the course is shown <font color="red">red</font> in the list.</li>
                <li>After <u>18 months</u>, the course is not shown in the public registry, but is still available in the backend.</li>
                <li>After <u>24 months</u>, the course is archived: it's not visible in the public registry or accessible through the
                    backend. To keep the history available, the course is still available through the API.</li>
